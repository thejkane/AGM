# Abstract Graph Machine and Distributed, Shared-Memory Parallel Graph Kernels

### Overview
Abstract Graph Machine (AGM) models orderings in asynchronous parallel graph algorithms. The AGM model expresses a graph algorithms as a function (AKA processing function) and an ordering (strict weak ordering relation). This repository contains an implementation of the AGM model, set of graph kernels implemented using the AGM model. In addition to AGM graph kernels, repository also, contains few distributed, shared-memory parallel graph kernels that does not use the AGM model.

#### Authors of AGM : Thejaka Amila Kanewala, Marcin Zalewski, Andrew Lumsdaine
